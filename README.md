### Important points 
- Note that the system is developed following the standard double entry accounting , hence every financial transaction will have two journal entries each affecting (i.e debit / crediting) its own financial account .
- the first step in the testing process is to register a customer via http://localhost:8080/customer/create api and get **accountNumber**
- you can always use http://localhost:8080/transaction/getTransactionDetail?referenceNumber= api to see details about any financial transaction 
- you can also use http://localhost:8080/customer/getAccountBalance?customerAccountNumber= to verify change in customer's account balance  .
